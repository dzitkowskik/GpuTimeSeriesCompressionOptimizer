@misc{MOSTAK,
	Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a focus on using distributed clusters of computers to compute aggregates and other statistics for massive datasets. While these approaches, such as the popular MapReduce framework, are invaluable for extracting actionable information from petabyte-sized datasets, such methods typically require large amounts of hardware (even on a per-byte basis) and suffer from relatively high computational overheads due to the large amount of inter-node communication and synchronization involved. Moreover, for medium-to-large size datasets of less than a few hundred gigabytes, such methods introduce latencies that prevent real-time analysis of data, something immensely valuable in diverse fields such as business intelligence, disaster response, and financial market analysis, among others.},
